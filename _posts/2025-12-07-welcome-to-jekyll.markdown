Categorical Probability Theory applies one area of maths (Category Theory) to another (Probability Theory). With the hope that this will give us some serious benefits: diagramtic languages, greater abstraction and proof generalisation, applicability to Probabilistic programming languages etc. It's a very cool field and one which is full of surprises.

My masters dissertation 'Applications of Monoidal Topology to Categorical Probability Theory' (I admit its a bit of a mouthful) is about using category theory to translate ideas from topology into probability. This gives us some objects that are weird from the point of view of standard probability theory but keep reappearing in different places (quasi-baysianism, infra-Baysianism ,imprecise probability). To get the ideas from my dissertation straight in my head, I'm going to write a few blog posts about them. Hope you enjoy!


Some prerequisites: you need to know what a monad is, and prefereably an algebra of a monad... I think this + the basic category theory that comes with it should be enough but I guess we'll find out later on!
